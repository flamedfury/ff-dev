hello world

Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [fLaMEd](about) ðŸ”¥ and this is my homepage, a collection of stuff that i like.

I have had a passion for making homepages for a long time. There's always been a time in my life where I have had a homepage in one form or another.

 This homepage is being constructed in public, it is constantly under construction. I will often push changes to it to try things out. I spend too much time coding and configuring and need to focus on writing the never ending stream of ideas and concepts down. This is my current mission.

I chose Neocities as my initial homepage host to step away from the corporate web and to not be surrounded by likes, shares, claps, stars, retweets, or whatevers. However since then I've gravitated back to Netlify to take advantage of the advanced features that they offer as a static host.

I love the Internet, [but not all things about the Internet](manifesto), you can read more over on my [about page](about). If you want to dive deeper, check out my [memoirs page](memoirs) which detail my earliet memories of getting online and surfing the web, and my [web manifesto](manifesto) where I share my thoughts on the current state of the web.

If you've enjoyed your time here, please leave a message in my [guestbook](https://guestbook.flamedfury.com), or send me an [e-mail](mailto:flamed@flamedfury.com).
